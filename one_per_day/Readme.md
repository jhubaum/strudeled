# One per day
To learn about strudel.cc build one simple track per day

- 01_wavering_synth.cc: I wanted to build a synth wave track but didn't find good instruments (neither in their individual sounds nor as a whole)
- 02_thirteen_seconds.cc: I took a percussive track from yesterday that I found kinda fun and added a simple melody. Took almost no time to create this.
