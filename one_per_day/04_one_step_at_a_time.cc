// I almost didn't write this. The last week has been a lot, and I used today to rest.
// I was tired and not in the mood to do anything. But in the evening, I pulled myself together
// and sat down in front of my PC. This track is part of a pact I made with myself. And it doesn't
// have to be good. It's just about moving forward. One step at a time...
